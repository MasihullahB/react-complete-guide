# Practice project in section 5

A practice project which covers the topics of,

- Creating sub components and passing data to them with the help of props.
- Creating reusable components.
- Creating a list of same components via looping over an array of objects with the help of map()
- I have additionally used concept of object destructuring while accessing values in passed as props and while accessing object properties of each concept item.
